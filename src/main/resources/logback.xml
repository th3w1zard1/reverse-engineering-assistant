    Logback configuration for ReVa MCP Server
    
    CRITICAL: This configuration ensures that log messages do NOT interfere with the MCP JSON-RPC protocol
    while keeping ALL logging visible (no suppression).
    
    Problem: Java log messages (from Ghidra's Msg.info(), etc.) were being sent over the HTTP streamable
    transport, causing the Python MCP client to try parsing them as JSON-RPC messages. This resulted in
    errors like "Unexpected token 'I', 'INFO  Usin'... is not valid JSON".
    
    Solution:
    - All logs are written to stderr (not stdout) to avoid interfering with JSON-RPC protocol
    - NO suppression - all logging levels remain at their default/requested levels
    - Logs go to stderr where they can be seen but won't interfere with the HTTP response stream
-->
<configuration>
    <!-- Console appender that writes to stderr (not stdout) to avoid interfering with MCP JSON-RPC protocol -->
    <!-- This ensures logs are visible but don't get mixed into the HTTP response stream -->
    <appender name="STDERR" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <target>System.err</target>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    
    <!-- Root logger - writes to stderr only (never stdout) -->
    <!-- All logging levels are preserved - no suppression -->
    <root level="DEBUG">
        <appender-ref ref="STDERR"/>
